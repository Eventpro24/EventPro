# Event Camera Preliminary
![evcam](./imgs/event_camera.png)
Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that operate asynchronously and independently for each pixel. Instead of capturing images at a fixed time interval, event cameras record asynchronous changes in pixel brightness, resulting in a stream of events with *microsecond* resolution. When a pixel detects a change in light intensity of a predefined magnitude in the scene, it immediately outputs an event $e_k \doteq \left(\mathbf{x}_k, t_k, p_k\right)$, encoding the triggered position $\mathbf{x}_k$, the triggered time $t_k$, and polarity $p_k$ (+1 for brighter and -1 for darker) of the intensity changes.

# System Overview
We propose **EventPro**, a comprehensive system employing advanced event cameras focusing on propeller rotation to sense drones.
**EventPro** features two components:

- *Count Every Rotation*. We propose an accurate, real-time propeller speed estimation pipeline by mitigating ultra-high sensitivity of event cameras to environmental noise.

- *Every Rotation Counts*. Based on the estimatd propeller speed, we propose algorithms to accurately infer both the drone internal flight commands and external flight status.

# Implementation
We implement **EventPro** with a commercial event camera, the [Prophesee EVK4 HD evaluation kit](https://www.prophesee.ai/event-camera-evk4/) , which is equipped with the IMX636ES event-based vision sensor for high-definition event data capture (1280 Ã— 720 pixels) using the [Soyo SFA0820-5M lens](http://www.soyocctv.com/products_detail.asp?id=1218&cataid=183&list=1). Our implementation contains more than 20000 LOC (lines of Python code). **EventPro** operates on a laptop equipped with an Intel i7-12900K CPU, and 32GB RAM, running on the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system. The event camera is connected to the laptop via USB 3.0.

# Experiment Setup

## Indoor Experiments
We build a laboratory testbed featuring a rotating propeller mounted on a brushless motor shaft. The setup comprises a laptop and an [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3?_gl=1*3lnkvq*_gcl_au*NDU3MzA2NTI2LjE3MjYxMzAxNzY.*FPAU*NDU3MzA2NTI2LjE3MjYxMzAxNzY.*_ga*MTU0MDMzNTIzLjE3MjYxMzAxNzQ.*_ga_NEXN8H46L5*MTcyNjI5NDE0OC4yLjEuMTcyNjI5NDE1NS4wLjAuODA1Mjc0MzYy*_fplc*czJWZGp2eUgxVjFyR2xtQk9NVGxsYVRzT1dFdXNhaXZScWh6JTJCRmI2MXRrbUQlMkJ3RlBRRnpsdm1PTmppMklsdSUyRnJHRjU5WTF6MXVlVVYxYmJ3cTVTUW04ZWp4ZmZWbWU5ZjM2MGhQRHV1bVklMkY0QW5tTEhra3JPU1p5Skl1RGclM0QlM0Q.) to control the motor's speed by adjusting the duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signal. The laptop transmits the PWM parameters to the Arduino Uno via a serial port, which then relays the PWM signal to the motor's Electronic Speed Controller (ESC). An event camera was positioned in front of the propeller.

## Outdoor Experiments
We adopt a commercial delivery drone and conduct real-world experiments in a test field. This drone is manufactured by a company specializing in daily and city-wide instant delivery services. The drone features six propellers attached to brushless motors and is controlled by a [PX4](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/) flight controller. An event camera was positioned on a ground-based bracket to capture the drone in flight.

## Code
Code will be made publicly available before publication.
